My name is Ravi Kalla. I'm an a software engineer worked as a manager and data scientist. I'm originally from India, but I moved to USA in 2012.
I love all foods, particularly Thai food. But strangely I'm allergic to shell fish.
I like playing with my kids who are 9 year and 6 year old.
In my free time, I play pickle ball and pingpong.
